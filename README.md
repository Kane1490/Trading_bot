# Trading_bot
Project 3: crypto trading bot. 

Our aim is to create a number of successful algorithmic trading bots that trade our strategies with the removal of human element. 

This will include a Top coin strategy, a MACD strategy, and a strategy that takes in numerous TA signals. 

Back tests will be included. 

We have used a number of different sources to put this togther. Python dcumentation, github, stack overflow and youtube to name a few. From this data we have implentent our strategies and modified to suit our needs.

Authors of this project include Kane Moore and Damien Jennings.
